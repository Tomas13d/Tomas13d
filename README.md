My passion for business led me to get involved in the IT world as a developer. I understood there that every company has a common denominator: people.
So I decided to train as a coach to improve my leadership, teamwork and communication skills.
  Here I leave you my projects, I hope they serve to inspire you and take new ideas. If you have any questions, you can contact me by any of the means above.
